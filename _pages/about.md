Over the past three decades, optical coherence tomography (OCT) has transcended the boundaries between laboratory research and clinical practice, emerging as the gold standard for retinal imaging. Its diagnostic utility extends to a range of diseases, including glaucoma and diabetic retinopathy, and it has shown promise in the assessment of neurodegenerative disorders such as multiple sclerosis (MS) and Alzheimer's disease. Additionally, researchers are actively exploring the potential of OCT in areas such as dermatology, cardiology, urology, and cancer diagnosis.

Despite these impressive achievements, the cellular and molecular sensitivity of OCT remains limited by factors such as aberration, multiple scattering photons, and the inability to detect fluorescence. Our laboratory is dedicated to developing technologies that can overcome these barriers, paving the way for the next generation of OCT in clinical practice. Furthermore, we collaborate closely with biologists to bring OCT to the realm of small animal imaging, enabling us to address fundamental questions in basic science research.

Positions
=====
### **Graduate Research Assistant**
The lab is seeking a highly motivated graduate student with a background in Physics or a related field to pursue a Master's degree in either EECE or Clinical Engineering at Miami University. We strongly prefer candidates with demonstrated excellence in one or more of the following areas:
- Experience working on the optical bench.
- A solid foundation in physical optics and Electric & Magnetic Fields.
- Proficiency in programming languages such as Python, Matlab, Julia, C#, or C.
- Ability to work independently and efficiently
- Interest in pursuing a career in the medical device industry
- Creativity and innovative thinking

 The student will work with Dr. Hui Wang to develop a new generation of optical coherence tomography. Opportunities include but are not limited to developing an adaptive optical imaging system, using deep learning for wavefront derivation, simulating photon scattering with Monte Carlo, and GPU programming with an ultrahigh-speed camera for in vivo real-time imaging. The lab is equipped with a femtosecond laser, a supercontinuum laser, three OCT systems, high-performance computers, and other advanced equipment. Students interested in pursuing a Ph.D. degree can also apply to the [CMSB](https://www.miamioh.edu/cas/academics/programs/cmsb/index.html) program.
 


### **Undergraduate Research Assistant**
We are currently seeking junior or sophomore students majoring in Physics, EECE, or CS. 
The students will trained to
- Assist in the development of a novel optical coherence tomography imaging system.  
- Gain hands-on experience with various optical, mechanical, and electronic devices.  
- Develop skills in medical device development.  
- Learn imaging and data processing through artificial intelligence.  
- Work on small animal imaging (ideal for premed students)   

The student will have the opportunity to apply for a [summer scholarship](https://www.miamioh.edu/student-research/research-opportunities/uss/index.html) with Dr. Wang through CPB. If the application is successful, the student will receive a stipend of $3,200 through the undergraduate summer scholarship program. The ideal candidates should have a good GPA and, some background in optics or programming or electronics, and be able to commit time to conduct research.
